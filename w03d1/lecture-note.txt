// web servers
- speak HTTP (for the most part)

- TCP is low level connection betwen machines (highway)

- HTTP sits on top of TCP 
- TCP sends info whenever we want (either party)

- TCP requires 
-- IP address (localhost)
-- POST 

- HTTP: request/response cycle (trucks carrying info)
  - request   
    - verb / method : what we want to do
      - GET: retrieve info from a server
      - POST: send info to the server
    - path: what we want to do it to 
      - /users, /videos,
    - Response:
      - may or may not contain info.

                          request 
client <== http / tcp ==> server
server.on("connection", (connection) => {
  connection.write('hello')
});
server.on('request'), (request, response) => {
  response.write('hello')  // only once chance to respond
  response.end();
}) //we need object to represent request and response


node.js

xxx listner: it means it's optional 


// Middleware
- sits / runs between the request and the response
- usually used for parsing or authentication

                                                    request
client <== http / tcp ==> server / middleware     middleware    middleware  / RouthHandler

middleware: bunch of different functions.
