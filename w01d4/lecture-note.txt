//iteration methods
  .forEach
  for c-style
  while


//shortcuts for c-style
  for..of: Arrays or Strings (don't need index)
  for..in: Object (keys), Arrays

// Object.keys
// Object.values
// Object.entries

// every iteration has its own scope, thats why you can use for (const key of object). 
// for c style: we change the i every time, therefore it should be let.

//function definitions are hoisted
  we can put myFunction() at the very top before defining it. 

//dont write function definition -- it's evil -- because it's hoisted

//function definition
  function myFunc() {}

//function expressions
  const myFunc = func() {}
  const myFunc = () => {}

//.forEach(value, index, array) <- order of parameters matter because it's builtin, and we should respect it. 

// but for callback functions <- order of callback functions don't matter


//Higher order functions : they will not complete a task by themselves.
  1. Needs a callback function to be complete
    e.g. forEach(arr, callback)
  2. HOF will generate a function definition
