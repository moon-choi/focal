@REQUIREMENTS / USER STORIES

As a logged in user, I can
As a non-logged in user, I can’t

we turn the requirements into user stories
4-8 stories

planning/user-stories.md (include this in GitHub)

planning directory

figma (wireframe), draw.io == lowest fidelity possible!!

take a photo of pics with pen and paper and add it to planning directory

—

all resource end points are plural
/users /cats

action endpoints are singluar
/login /logout

B get
R get
E post
A post
d post

@ difference PUT / PATCH
PUT: garbage the existing one, completely replace the resource
PATCH: not replacing the entire record, just updating. very surgical.. (most of the time this one is used)

for midterm, client will be enough

Client: single connection to the database (one waiter)

Pool: collection of clients. managed collection. we dont have to do anything

Pool works like calling a taxi..dispatcher..
bunch of clients waiting for messages to come in

client: i want taxi number 3.

—

elehant SQL: only 5 connections

—

chalk colours your console log.

—
pool.connect

express is the client, and server is the server
